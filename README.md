# First MEGA-ACE Hakcathon
This instructions are for the 1st [MEGA-ACE hackathon](https://mega-ace.org/hackathon)
organized by [MEGA-ACE](https://mega-ace.org/) group, an 
[Algorand Center of Excellence](https://www.algorand.foundation/ace).

## Technical Challenges
The Technical Challenges track is focused on the technical aspects of the Algorand 
blockchain and is aimed at developers who want to test their skills and demonstrate 
their mastery of the technology. Participants will be given challenging problems of 
varying levels of difficulty (beginner, medium and advanced). 

To participate in this challenge, clone this repository and look into each 
problem independently. In each case you are supposed to solve a specific
technical problem by coding a solution. In each folder you will see tests
that run against your solution. These (public) tests will be used to grade
your solution. On top of this, other (non-public) tests will be added which
validate that your candidate solution does solve the problem. Once the 
submission deadline is reached, we will work offline to run the tests,
grade the solutions and publish results.

Check the detailed rules in the hackathon's [website](https://mega-ace.org/hackathon).

Problems are listed below. Follow the links for specific instructions.

### Instructions
Clone this repository. Each sub-directory includes one challenge problem.  The problem statements are defined in the readme file within each of these directories. The solutions must be included in these directories following the rules and the directory structure *must not* be modified.

Once you are done committing the solutions, go to the  hackathon's website and fill in the form with your username, Algorand address, git repository link and commit hash.
