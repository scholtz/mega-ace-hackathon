PyTeal: Algorand Smart Contracts in Python
==========================================

PyTeal is a Python language binding for `Algorand Smart Contracts (ASC1s) <https://developer.algorand.org/docs/asc>`_. 

Algorand Smart Contracts are implemented using a new language that is stack-based, 
called `Transaction Execution Approval Language (TEAL) <https://developer.algorand.org/docs/teal>`_. 

However, TEAL is essentially an assembly language.
With PyTeal, developers can express smart contract logic purely using Python. 
PyTeal provides high level, functional programming style abstactions over TEAL
and does type checking at construction time.

The :doc:`User Guide </data_type>` describes many useful features in PyTeal, and the complete documentation for every expression and operation can be found in the :doc:`PyTeal Package API documentation </api>`.

PyTeal **hasn't been security audited**. Use it at your own risk.
